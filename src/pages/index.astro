			<h2>Biography</h2>
			<p class="montserrat-text">I am a <strong><span class="highlight">4th year Computer Engineering major</span></strong>, focusing more on software, rather than hardware. I was originally admitted to <abbr title="University of California San Diego">UCSD</abbr> as an Aerospace Engineering Major, but figured out at the end of my first year that I enjoyed programming much more than Aerospace Engineering. In particular, I enjoyed the iterative problem solving style of programming, as opposed to the more waterfall style used in Aerospace Engineering. The <dfn>waterfall approach</dfn> plans and accounts for everthing ahead of time before beginning programming and does not produce an <dfn>MVP</dfn>, which stands for Minimal Viable Product, until the product is completely finished. I plan to become a software engineer in the future and my immediate plans include getting a masters in Data Science and Machine Learning with ECE department's BS/MS program. I chose to get my masters in Data Science and Machine Learning as I enjoy learning about both and see machine learning becoming a key part of software engineering in the future.</p>
